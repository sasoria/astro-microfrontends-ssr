# astro-microfrontends

This demo takes advantage of EcmaScript Modules (ESM) and url-imports to do server-side composition of microfrontends. Express is used for serving assets, but ideally one would have a dedicated CDN hosting them.

## Features

- ✨ Server-side composition of microfrontends
- 🚀 Server-side rendring of micro-frontends

## Usage

- Build each microfrontend with `npm run build`
- Start each microfrontend with `node server.js`
- Start the shell with `npm run dev`
